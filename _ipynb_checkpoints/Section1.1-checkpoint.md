# Introduction

Welcome to the [SURGE](https://surgeinnovation.ca) Discover Coding R-Gapminder workshop! This workshop is aimed at people from science disciplines who have no previous experience with a programming language. We teach the basic of coding using R, a very popular language used in science and data science. If you have programmed before, but are new to R, you will also find this workshop useful, if perhaps a bit slow at times. 

## Our Approach

This is not an introduction to computer science. The SURGE Discover Coding series aims to teach people working in science how to use R as a tool for working with data. As such, our focus is on:
- learning the fundamentals of R
- learning the fundamentals of programming logic
- using R for data science, including:
    - reading data
    - manipulating/processing data (e.g., extracting specific data, splitting data according to variables, applying functions, combining data)
    - exploratory data analysis
    - basic statistical analyses of data sets

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this workshop, you will be able to:
- understand and use variables
- work with common R data types like integers, floats, strings, characters, lists, dictionaries, as well as NumPy arrays and Pandas DataFrames.
- read data from text files
- obtain basic summary statistics from data files
- manipulate and extract data from pandas DataFrames
- visualize data using R's Matplotlib package, and customize these plots
- use basic flow control, including for loops and conditionals
- write R code according to standard style guidelines

## Cloud-Based R

For this workshop, we will use a cloud-based resource ([CoCalc](https://cocalc.com)) for all of the programming. When you register for a workshop, you will receive instructions to create an account on CoCalc. Please do this *before* the start of the workshop to avoid delays. Then at the start of the workshop, attendees' CoCalc accounts will be updagraded to a paid version for the duration of the workshop. 

Using CoCalc has a number of advantages, including not needing to worry about installing R on your own computer, or limitations of the type or specifications of the computer you have. As well, workshop attendees will have all the data files they need, and "skeleton" files for each workshop, automatically copied to their CoCalc accounts. An added advantage of the cloud platform is that members of the teaching team can see the work of any participant in the workshop. This is very useful when participants get stuck and need help.

If you want to install R on your own computer — either to follow along with a workshop, or to use afterwards — that's fine. We recommend you install [Anaconda R](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which is a complete scientific R installation containing everything you'll need for the workshop, and likely for the majority of your future data science work as well. However, if you run R on your own computer, instead of on the cloud server for this workshop, we will not be able to view your work if you are having trouble — so our ability to suport you will be more limited. 

If you do install Anaconda R, the easiest way to run it is to launch the [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/), and then start Jupyter Lab.
