# Practice

Here are some additional practice and examples for you to try out!

1) For this question you will practice creating variables that contain expressions. You will need to create 4 variables:
    - store a temperature value in Fahrenheit as a variable
    - store in another variable the conversion expression/equation from Fahrenheit to Celsius
    - store in another variable the conversion from  Celsius to Kelvin
    - store in another variable the conversion from Fahrenheit to Kelvin
