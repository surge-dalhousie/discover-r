# discover-r

Adaptation of Library Carpentries' "Introduction to R" lesson for the [SURGE](https://surgeinnovation.ca) Discover Coding series.

This repository is designed to be cloned to [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com) so that notebooks can be run there, during live/synchronous lessons. There are versions of the notebooks with code included, and copies of these with code removed, so that participants in workshops can type the code in themselves, during lessons.

The repository also hosts a GitHub Pages site with all the lesson materials, including the 'with-code' notebook files, rendered in HTML.
