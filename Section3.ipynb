If you are working with another format, they can be both specified by the user. Check out the help for read_csv() by typing ?read_csv to learn more.

    "## What are data frames and tibbles?\n",
    "Data frames are the de facto data structure for tabular data in R, and what we use for data processing, statistics, and plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers, factors). For example, here is a figure depicting a data frame comprising a numeric, a character, and a logical vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the functions read_csv() or read_table(); in other words, when importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).\n",
    "\n",
    "A tibble is an extension of R data frames used by the tidyverse. When the data is read using read_csv(), it is stored in an object of class tbl_df, tbl, and data.frame. You can see the class of an object with class().\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inspecting data frames\n",
    "When calling a tbl_df object (like interviews here), there is already a lot of information about our data frame being displayed such as the number of rows, the number of columns, the names of the columns, and as we just saw the class of data stored in each column. However, there are functions to extract this information from data frames. Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of these functions. Let’s try them out!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Size:\n",
    "    - dim(books) - returns a vector with the number of rows in the first element, and the number of columns as the second element (the dimensions of the object)\n",
    "    - nrow(books) - returns the number of rows\n",
    "    - ncol(books) - returns the number of columns\n",
    "- Content:\n",
    "    - head(books) - shows the first 6 rows\n",
    "    - tail(books) - shows the last 6 rows\n",
    "- Names:\n",
    "    - names(books) - returns the column names (synonym of colnames() for data.frame objects)\n",
    "- Summary:\n",
    "    - View(books) - look at the data in the viewer\n",
    "    - str(books) - structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column\n",
    "    - summary(books) - summary statistics for each column\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: most of these functions are “generic”, they can be used on other types of objects besides data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "The map() function from purrr is a useful way of running a function on all variables in a data frame or list. If you loaded the tidyverse at the beginning of the session, you also loaded purrr. Here we call class() on books using map_chr(), which will return a character vector of the classes for each variable."
